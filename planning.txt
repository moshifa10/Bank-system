I am thinking of making a json file that stores users info 
    info - user's details including
    money - current money, money users owes
    id - so that I track them by their ids

functions or imports:
    add user - adding (new) user to the system
    deleting - delete available user
    edit details/ update details - updating details
    forgot password - User will be allowed to change passwords


current user:
    view balance - user can view thier balance
    transfer money - transferring to existing  users
    pay  - user will be able to pay for products in any shop

testing:
    testing functions





Whenever a user buys they should specify for what and save those items for history
